# BFSandDFS-PathFinder

Program reads in a grid in text format and utilizes uninformed search algorithms to find the optimal path.
The result is then written to another text file showing the path from the start to the goal. The user
can choose between using depth-first search or breadth-first search. To use the program make sure that
all the files are in the same directory. Next, open up a terminal and 'cd' into the appropriate directory
with all of the program files. Finally, type 'python uninformedSearch.py' to run the program.
